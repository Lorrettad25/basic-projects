# Basic Python Data Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates data analysis and visualization using:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `feature-engine`

It includes a script (`main.py`) and a Jupyter notebook (`example.ipynb`) that generate sample data and plots.
